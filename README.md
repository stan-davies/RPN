soup: stack output precedence
So sure, a terribly silly name, but I like it. This uses a variation of
Dijkstra's yard shunting algorithm (I *think*...). Essentially it uses two
stacks, an output and an operator, and then puts a big emphasis on operator
precedence to **get stuff done**.

The evaluation of this is done by the classic stack method. That is the *entire*
point of using RPN.
